        <div class="emporium_body">
            <p>The Shop is where you can build and acquire new weapons that can't be found anywhere else in the game. Create new guns by combining regular weapons with Forging Hardware (FH) that you'll acquire by completing Jobs (special missions that are completed in a match) or by spinning the Wheel of Fate after completing a match. Welcome, and let's get started, soldiers!</p>

            <p class="shop_p1">
                In the shop, directly purchasable items in Combat Arms are also found, including most of the massive arsenal of Combat Arms Weapons! Items can be purchased for GP, which is earned through in-game play, or Nexon Cash, which can be charged via PayPal, credit card or other sources.<br>
                Either use the Search Bar to search for an item by name, or use the filter tab to narrow things down so you can browse through the Shop. Filter categories include:

                    <h4>HOT:</h4>Items on sale, new weapons, and other popular content is placed here. It's the best place to see what's new and interesting in the Shop!

                <li>
                    <h4>NEW:</h4>The New section contains all recently released items.

                    <h4>COSMETIC:</h4>All of the items in the Cosmetic category, when equipped, are displayed over the equipped gear for that slot, instead of giving a stat boost of their own. Items are sorted into the Character, Head, Face, Vest and Backpack slots.

                <li>
                    <h4>SPECIAL:</h4>All Specialist items, weapons, licenses, characters and abilities are all contained here, sorted into two categories: The Operatives and the Assassins.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>MODIFICATION:</h4>Most weapons allow you to add on Suppressors, Scopes, or Magazine modifications to make them more effective, and this is the place to get them. Modifications are sorted by weapon type.

                <li>
                    <h4>CLAN:</h4>Show your clan's colors with these specialized Clan items. Most of these are only usable by players in a clan, and some only by the clan's leader.

                The Customization section of the Shop will allow you to add special customization components to some existing weapons which will alter some aspect of their stats.<br><br>

            <ul class="custom1">

                <li>
                    Only certain weapons can be Customized. However any weapon displayed in the Customization Inventory window is eligible to be Customized.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eligible weapons will have a number of "customization slots." These slots determine how many customizations can be placed on a weapon. Warning! Whether or not a customization succeeds or fails, Customization Parts will be used up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the slot you would like to customize from the Customization Slot

                    Select what level you would like to upgrade the weapon's slot to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The results of the proposed customization are visible next to the selected weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The higher level you customize to, the more Customization Parts will be required.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If desired, you can use GP to boost the odds of getting a successful Customization.

                <li>
                    Note the probability of success is displayed in the upper right next to your weapon. Failure results in the loss of the Customization Parts. You will not lose the original weapon or the Customization Slot, however.
